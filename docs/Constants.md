# Constants

Joyride uses a few constants to keep its state and you can use these in your component for the callback events.

[Actions](/src/constants/actions.js) - The action that updated the state.

[Events](/src/constants/events.js) - The type of the event.

[Lifecycle](/src/constants/lifecycle.js) - The step lifecycle.

[Status](/src/constants/status.js) - The tour's status.
